**Titanic Survival Prediction (ML Project)**
**Project Overview**

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.
It covers data cleaning, feature encoding, and preparation for ML models.
The project was developed in Google Colab for easy reproducibility.

**Steps Completed**
1. **Data Loading:**
      Loaded Titanic dataset using seaborn.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   Filled missing age with median
   Filled missing embarked with mode
   Dropped deck (too many missing values)
   Dropped rows with missing embark_town
3. **Encoding:**
    sex encoded using LabelEncoder
    embarked encoded using OneHotEncoding
4. **Final Cleaned Dataset:**
    Ready for ML training.
   
 **Tech Stack**
    Python
    Google Colab
    Pandas,Numpy
    Seaborn,Matplotlib
    Scikit-learn

2. Upload the .ipynb file from this repo.
3. Run all cells step by step.

**Next Steps**
   Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
   Compare accuracy & performance.
   Deploy the best model as a web app.
